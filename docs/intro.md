# Apollo overview

Welcome to **Apollo** – AC6’s learning space focused on embedded security for connected and safety‑critical systems.

This documentation is organised around a single main track:

- **Security** – concepts, regulations (including the EU Cyber Resilience Act), and practical controls for embedded products.

Use the left sidebar or the top navigation to explore the Security topics. Each page is designed to be short, practical, and reference‑friendly so you can use it during design reviews, trainings, or audits.

## How to navigate

- Start with **Security → Overview** to understand why embedded security and CRA matter.  
- Use the CRA sub‑section under Security for anything related to conformity, documentation, and processes.

You can switch between **English**, **Français**, **Deutsch** and the Nordic languages using the language menu in the navbar. All languages share the same structure so you can share links with mixed teams.
