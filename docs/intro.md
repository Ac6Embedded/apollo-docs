# Apollo overview

Welcome to **Apollo** - AC6's learning space for embedded systems. The site is organized by tracks so you can jump straight to the area you need:

- **Security** - concepts, regulations (including the EU Cyber Resilience Act), and practical controls for embedded products. Sub-tracks include CRA.

Each track starts with an overview and each sub-track (for example, Security > CRA) has its own overview so you always have a short landing page.

## How to navigate

- Use the top navigation or the left sidebar to pick the Security track, then open its Overview.
- Within the track, drill into the sub-track overviews before reading deeper tutorials or checklists.

You can switch between **English**, **Francais**, and **Svenska** using the language menu in the navbar. The structure is identical in each language so shared links stay valid.
