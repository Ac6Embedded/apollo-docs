## How to use these references

This page collects **authoritative sources** and **supporting standards** for the CRA tutorial.

- Use the **CRA primary sources** to verify any legal interpretation or borderline case.  
- Use the **guidance and standardisation links** to track evolving harmonised standards (PT1/PT2/PT3, vertical product standards).  
- Use the **SDL, vulnerability, SBOM and IoT baseline standards** as concrete technical backing for design decisions documented in your CRA technical file.   

Each tutorial page in this series links back here when it relies on one of these external documents.

## Notes on Harmonised Standards (Dec 2025)

- As of Dec 2025, CRA harmonised standards have not yet been cited in the OJ. The Commission’s standardisation request to ESOs is in progress. Until citation, manufacturers may rely on robust international/European standards (e.g., IEC 62443‑4‑1/‑4‑2, ETSI EN 303 645) and well‑recognized frameworks (e.g., NIST SSDF). The Commission may adopt common specifications if necessary (CRA Art. 27).
