## What you get

- **Scope and classification**: PDE identification, important/critical status, role allocation
- **Engineering controls**: Practical mappings for boot, isolation, crypto, updates, identity, logging
- **Secure development lifecycle**: Gating, tooling, evidence, and variant-aware SBOM/VEX
- **Technical documentation**: How to produce and maintain CRA evidence packages
- **Vulnerability handling**: PSIRT workflow, triage, timelines, and reporting
- **Audit/readiness review**: Checklist and gap-closing plan
