The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) introduces mandatory cybersecurity requirements across the product lifecycle for hardware and software with digital elements.[1] Developers must adopt secure development practices, maintain documentation, and support vulnerability handling to achieve conformity and CE marking.

This section provides a developer‑focused view with practical guidance, examples, and checklists rooted in Annex I essential requirements and Articles 16–24 duties.[1][2] Start with Scope and Requirements, then map to Embedded Technical Controls, SDL, SBOM/VEX, and Conformity. Each page references the Official Journal text so you can quote the precise clause when writing design documentation or responding to auditors.
