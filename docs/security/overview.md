Embedded devices are increasingly connected and safety‑critical. A single vulnerability can lead to safety hazards, service downtime, IP loss, or regulatory non‑compliance. Building in security from the start reduces lifecycle risk and total cost of ownership.

Key drivers:

- Safety: Prevent unsafe behavior due to malicious inputs or faults.
- Compliance: Meet emerging regulations (e.g., EU Cyber Resilience Act).
- Resilience: Limit blast radius and enable secure recovery.
- Trust: Safeguard data, IP, and supply chain integrity.

Core pillars we’ll build upon:

- Threat modeling and secure architecture
- Root of trust, secure boot, and update integrity
- Memory protection and least privilege
- Secure communication and key management
- Vulnerability handling and incident response
